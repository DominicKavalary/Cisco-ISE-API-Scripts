# Cisco-ISE-API-Scripts
Decided to mess around with ISE API

Remember: for any ISE API calls that youre gonna make, make sure you make an admin user with access to ERC-Admin group and MNT_admin group or something similar

ISE-em.py: A script that goes to your ISE server and port bounces all of the airtame devices because you dislike people who cast. Gets credentials for ISE API from wndows credential manager. API User on ISE needs mnt admin and ers operator
